  <ul>
    <li>Open <a href="/admin/maintenance">Maintenance</a> page.</li>
    <li>Scroll down to <b>Cache</b> block and click <b>Clear cache</b> button.</li>
    <li>
      Scroll down to <b>Queues</b> block, select <b>multiplayer-games</b> in the <b>Queue</b> dropdown and click
      <b>Delete all jobs from the queue</b>. After that click <b>Stop queue worker</b> button
      (if the supervisor is configured properly the queue worker process will restart automatically).

    <li>Open <b>Crash game</b> page and refresh it.</li>

<div id="q02" style="padding-top: 90px;">
  <h6 class="text-h6 mb-3">What is the base number?</h6>
  <p>
    At any given time the current payout is calculated as follows:
  </p>
  <pre>
    P = N ^ T
  </pre>
  <p>
    This is an exponential function, where <code>N</code> is the base number defined in the settings and <code>T</code> is the current game duration
    (the number of seconds elapsed since the start of the game).
    The base number affects the speed at which the payout grows during the game.
    The higher the number, the faster the payout will increase and therefore the faster the crash will happen.
    It is recommended to change the base number gradually in 0.01 increments.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="q03" style="padding-top: 90px;">
  <h6 class="text-h6 mb-3">How do payout intervals work?</h6>
  <p>
    The payout (crash number) for each game is generated in 2 stages.
    First, one of the payout intervals is randomly selected.
    After that, a random decimal number is selected in this interval.
    This random number is the payout of the game (or the number at which the rocket will crash).
  </p>
  <p>
    You can use payout intervals to influence the overall game payouts.
    For instance, to reduce the return to player (and hence increase the house edge)
    you can create many intervals with small payouts and leave only few with large payouts.
    In this case, at the first stage, one of the small payout intervals is more likely to be selected, and large payouts will be rare.
    The last payout interval determines the maximum possible payout in the game.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="q04" style="padding-top: 90px;">
  <h6 class="text-h6 mb-3">Why is the max payout sometimes exceeded?</h6>
  <p>
    As explained above the payout is generated randomly before the start of the game.
    Then this number is used to calculate the game duration and the crash event time.
    A delayed job is scheduled for this time to finish the game and send the crash event to all connected players.
    The queue worker should pick up this job at the given time and process it.
    It can happen that the queue worker picks up the job a bit later than the scheduled time.
    Thus the original payout will no longer be correct and will be recalculated, which in turn will cause the payout to increase.
    If the original payout was close or equal to the max payout the new payout may be higher.
    If the queues are working properly, such cases should be rare.
